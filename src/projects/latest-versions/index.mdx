# ðŸŽ‰ Latest Versions

## Table of contents

```toc
```

## Details

So, my first little project is going to scrape a bunch of repos / websites for the latest version
of their product. 

The site will display those latest versions and update every day. It's a single source of truth for
a large range of products. It also doesn't have to be limited to software either...

The initial plan is to get the latest versions of these categories:
- Operating Systems
- Browsers
- IDEs

Then we'll build from there.

## test code block

```php
add_action( 'admin_footer', 'my_action_javascript' );

function my_action_javascript() { ?>
	<script type="text/javascript" >
    jQuery(document).ready(function($) {

  	var data = {
    	'action': 'my_action',
    	'whatever': 1234
  	};
  
  	// jQuery.post( url [,data ] [,success ] [,dataType ] )
  	jQuery.post(ajaxurl, data, function(response) {
    	alert('Got this from the server: ' + response);
  	});

	});
	</script> <?php
}
```

## Test inline code

This `code` should render well `\here\is\a\directory`.
